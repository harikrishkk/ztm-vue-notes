# Progressive web apps

- Mobile features to web
- Open from home, offline support, background sync, push notifications, access to hardware, geolocation, cameras etc
- PWA is a set of features & API in the browser.
- Can be incrementally added on.
- Can be used in non-spa sites.
  `Plugin => @vue/cli-plugin-pwa`

3 changes - main.js, an import for register servicr worker.

- public folder-> img folder

## Generate manifest file.

- They are cached.
- We need to build the project first
- VSCode plugin -> Live server
- Run the build from GUI
- manifest.json is available here.
- open with dist as root.
- Application > Manifest > manifest.json
- Lighthouse > Tick PWA

- vue.config.js can overwrite settings.

```
  pwa: {
    name: 'Music App',
    themeColor: '#ff5e3a',
    manifestOptions: {
      short_name: 'Music',
    },
  },
```

Service workers:

- App to work offline.
- A JS file that runs in the background.
- App & SW that cant talk each other. JS is single threaded.
- Cache files, push notifications, background sync, No access to DOM
- Limited browser support
- Cache first, then network strategy ( good for static files )
- Network first, then cache
- Workbox library
- Application > Service worker > Offline
- Cache storage shows the items being cached.

## Firebase data persistance

In firebase.js

```
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

const auth = firebase.auth();
const db = firebase.firestore();
const storage = firebase.storage();

db.enablePersistence().catch((err) => {
  console.log('Firebase persistance error');
});
```

Handle offline uploads

```
  methods: {
    upload($event) {
      this.is_dragover = false;
      const files = $event.dataTransfer
        ? [...$event.dataTransfer.files]
        : [...$event.target.files];
      files.forEach((file) => {
        if (file.type !== 'audio/mpeg') {
          return;
        }
        if (!navigator.onLine) {
          this.uploads.push({
            task: {},
            current_progress: 100,
            name: file.name,
            variant: 'bg-red-400',
            icon: 'fas fa-times',
            text_class: 'text-red-400',
          });
          return;
        }
```
